Design easier and faster with more utilities for UIKit Items

This library will allow you to modify in real time the different UIKit items with their new functionalities (gradients, rounded edges, shadows...) from the inspectors, as well as from the code itself.


## Example

There are no examples available in this repository yet, but it works like a normal UIKit Item with more functionality, both from inspectors and code.

As an alternative you can see how I use it in AstroData repository: https://github.com/Gonzalo-MR8/AstroData.git
